### **The Travel Corporation**
TTC has a wide and rich set of experiences to distribute to its travel agency partners and wants to offer them all the flexibility available to its own consultants and guests. To achieve this, Featurist has worked extensively with our internal sales experts and with key partners to build an elaborate and yet flexible set of services to support the searching, pricing, and booking of experiences, flights, and value add across six of TTCâ€™s world-leading travel brands.

## **Technologies We Use**
- **Node.js**: We love Node.js for its excellent performance and flexibility. Having JavaScript on the frontend and backend simplifies everything.

- **Hosting**: For hosting our applications, we're fans of Heroku for its simplicity and Kubernetes for its flexibility and reliability.
- **Frontend**: We've enjoyed the transformations on the frontend with React, ReactNative, and the wonderful community.
